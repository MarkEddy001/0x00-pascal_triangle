## Resources
- Backtracking Introduction
- Recursion in Python
- Python Lists
- Command Line Arguments in Python

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
- Use recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
- Create and manipulate lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
- Handle command-line arguments with the `sys` module.

## Requirements
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*).
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- All `*.py` files should be executable.
- All modules should have documentation.
- All classes should have documentation.
- All functions and methods should have documentation.
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Files
- `0-nqueens.py`: Basic implementation of the N Queens algorithm.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Tasks

### 0. Basic N Queens Algorithm
