# README.md for Island Perimeter Project

## Project Title: Island Perimeter

### Description
The **Island Perimeter** project involves calculat[2;2R[>0;10;1cing the perimeter of an island represented in a grid. The grid is a 2D array where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. The goal is to determine the total length of the edges of the land cells that contribute to the perimeter of the island.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to apply knowledge of:
- **2D Arrays (Matrices)**: Understanding how to navigate and manipulate data in a grid format.
- **Conditional Logic**: Utilizing conditions to identify which cells contribute to the perimeter.
- **Counting Techniques**: Developing methods to count the edges that contribute to the island's perimeter.

### Concepts Covered
- **2D Arrays**:
  - Accessing and iterating over elements.
  - Navigating adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
  
- **Conditional Logic**:
  - Applying conditions to determine perimeter contributions.
  
- **Problem-Solving Strategies**:
  - Breaking down tasks into manageable components, such as identifying land cells.

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
- Each file should end with a new line and begin with the following shebang:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
